# Acre frontend test

Firstly, thank you for taking the time to complete our test.

Please feel free to complete as much of the test as you can. We don’t expect you to spend more than a couple of hours on this.

## We want you to

1. Consume the graphql server API and display a set of users on the client
2. Provide appropriate filtering for the user roles BROKER, ADMIN, ADVISOR
3. Filter users from the list if they dont have a name
4. Filter user who are able to create customers and display a create button (doesn’t have to do anything)

With a bonus points for styling and software engineering good practice.

# Getting started

```
